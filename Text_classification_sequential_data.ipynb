Note that each $h1, h2, h3$ is a 3D tensor with the shape $[batch\\_size \\times output\\_size \\times state\\_size]$.\n",
    "  - We then apply *GlobalMaxPool1D()* (reference [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GlobalMaxPool1D)) over $h1, h2, h3$ to obtain 2D tensors stored in $h1, h2, h3$ again.\n",
